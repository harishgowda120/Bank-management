### How to Add the `README.md` to Your Repository

1. **Create a `README.md` file**: 
   In your project's root directory, create a new file called `README.md`.

   If you're using the command line, you can create it with:

   ```bash
   touch README.md
   ```

2. **Add the content**: 
   Open the `README.md` file in a text editor and paste the above content, or modify it to fit your project.

3. **Commit the `README.md` to Git**:

   After adding the `README.md`, commit it to your Git repository:

   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README.md"
   git push origin main
   ```

Once you push the changes, the `README.md` will be visible in your GitHub repository.
